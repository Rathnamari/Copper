#***Copper price forecast***
This is an open source project aims at making a prediction of copper price using machine learning / deep learning approach. The language of this project is Python 
and the ideas may extend to other time series prediction problems as you like.

#***Motivation***
The motivation of launching this project is that copper is a kind of important raw material of some midstream and downstream materials, 
whose price is of great relevance to copper price. Thus a high accuracy of copper price prediction can to some extent providing purchasing decisions 
for the purchasing agent.

#***Problem Statement:***
The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing. However, this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, 
which can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. Dealing with these challenges manually can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions.
A machine learning regression model can address these issues by utilizing advanced techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and 
leveraging algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data.

Another area where the copper industry faces challenges is in capturing the leads. A lead classification model is a system for evaluating and classifying leads based 
on how likely they are to become a customer . You can use the STATUS variable with WON being considered as Success and LOST being considered as Failure and remove 
data points other than WON, LOST STATUS values.

#***The solution must include the following steps:***
Exploring skewness and outliers in the dataset. Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.
ML Regression model which predicts continuous variable ‘Selling_Price’. ML Classification model which predicts Status: WON or LOST. Creating a streamlit page 
where you can insert each column value and you will get the Selling_Price predicted value or Status(Won/Lost).
